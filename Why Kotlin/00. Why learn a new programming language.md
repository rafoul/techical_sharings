## 00. Why learn a new programming language?
Let`s face the fact,
- Each developer has him own favorate language and probably quite good at it.
- Under most cases you are able to implement anything you asked to with that language.

But if so, why are there so many languages, with new ones keep coming up? Do they(the authors) really have nothing else to do?

And I believe,
- Each language is developed to address a particular set of problems(recognized by the author).
- Language A can be dramatically more efficient in solving a paricular problem than language B, and vice versa.
- New languages or new versions of the same language tends to be an improvement over old languages or its old versions.

Kotlin is a JVM language, so what is wrong with Java?

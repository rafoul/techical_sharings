## 01. Extension: simple feature, big impact.
The idea itself is very simple and easy to understand, BUT,
It allows you to think in a fully OO fasion.
It is not always appropriate to have everything in a single place.
Legacy/Library code are not always friendly for extension.
It provides a more fluent coding style.

And you can use it anywhere.

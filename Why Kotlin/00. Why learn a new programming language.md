## 00. Why learn a new programming language?
Facts,
- Each developer has him own favorate language and is probably quite good at it.
- Under most cases you are able to implement anything you asked to implement with that language.

But if so, why are there so many languages, with new ones keep coming up? Do they(the authors) really have nothing else to do?

And I believe,
- A new language presents a new way of thinking, which may well be the single most important useful thing we could get from our daily work.
- A new language can be more efficient in solving a particular set of problems.
- A new language can be an improvement over a particular existing language.

As a developer, it is important to know whether there are better tools out there for our daily work.

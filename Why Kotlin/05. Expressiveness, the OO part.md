## 05. Expressiveness, the OO part

Constructor is part of class declaration.
You can have multiple constructors, which all falls back to one.

No more \`new\`, and you can also omit the type as well(available in Java 10).

Object delegation has never been so easy.

No more getter/setters, no more lombok. If you do need to customize getter/setter, it is part of property definition. The same style is used for both interface and classes.

Data class for entity classes.

Generics, a lot easier to use, guided by 'Effective Java'.

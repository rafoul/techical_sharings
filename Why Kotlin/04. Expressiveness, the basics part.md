## 04. Expressiveness, the basics part.

Built-in string template support.

Easy construction of arrays, collections and maps.

Fluent API for collections as well as general objects(let, also, run, apply).

Control flow can be used as expression.

\`when\`, say goodbye to \`switch\` and \`if-else\`(Rust\`s \`match\` is even more powerful).
